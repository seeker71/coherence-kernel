# Form-CLI fourth-kernel surface — the cornerstone baseline

The 4th-kernel form-cli is the body's self-evolving spine: it senses its own
gaps, drafts recipes with a LOCAL oracle, proves them four-way (Go/Rust/TS +
the emitted `fkwu` kernel), and runs each as native tissue for the next
iteration. `fkwu` carries two faces over the same
emit — the universal PROOF-WALKER (`fkc-emit-universal`) validate.sh gates
four-way, and a SELF-JIT (`fkc-nat-expr`/`fkc-emit-jit2`) that crystallizes
hot pure functions to native and melts them on cool, champion-challenger
re-earned (jit-lower 15, full-jit-lower 63, champion-challenger 127). The
SAME recipe IS the proof (walked four-way) AND the native binary (crystallized
on heat, or lowered through the asm lever to a signed dylib) — no separate
native impl, no clang dependency. This doc is the living inventory + north-star alignment of that
surface across twelve families, and the open rework plan that keeps it supple.
The floor source for four-way coverage stays `form/fourth-arm-bands.txt`; this
doc names purpose, grammar altitude, axiom relationships, and what is still
climbing toward the native ideal.

**Standing alignment:** 73/100 — the body's *ideas* are north-star; *proof and altitude* lag, concentrated in the grammar/compiler/host-OS spine. The lift is the cornerstone investment.

## Baseline floor — what stands proven

The cornerstone floor at the altitude this audit measures:

- **The principled BMF cursor crosses the fourth arm** — bmf-core (the cursor + data-driven matcher, verdict 600) and bmf-grammar (the recursive grammar engine: rule references, recursion, operator precedence, paren nesting, separator-lists + splice*, verdict 300) are **four-way proven incl. fkwu, 0 divergent**. One data-driven matcher, grammars-as-data, parsing-produces-recipes, no-sediment backtracking — the strongest north-star realization in the audit — is provable on the fourth kernel. The string cursor (char_at/ord/substring) rides the shim string stones (tags 24..29); the parse emits universal recipes through the content-addressed intern arm (intern_node tag 47, bp tag 45, trivial interns tags 43/46, make_nodeid tag 91); `intern_node_at` rides the fourth-shim image of the carried intern — its returned NodeID is exactly `intern_node(cat, kids)`, the source attribution feeding only the framebuffer side-map the verdict never reads. This carries the whole BMF/dialect surface (bmf-core, bmf-grammar, bmf-to-fk, http-parse, the evals) toward provable.
- **Buffer model generalized** — the `ll-*` memory leaves are one parameterized family `ll-alloc(n)/ll-store(rt,off)/ll-load(rt,off)/ll-free(n)` + composed `ll-buf` round-trip, **four-way proven incl. fkwu**.
- **The G1 lever is complete — the whole lower surface crosses four-way.** `form-lower` lowers all four lever families to native arm64, each byte-for-byte the assembler's: memory (`ll-buffer` — sp alloc/store/load/free), strings (`form-lower-streq` — `str_eq` → byte-compare loop, primitive `fa-cmp-r`), host-io (`form-lower-readfile` — `read_file` → open/read/close svc, on `fa-svc`/`fa-movz-x`), and the general multi-arg **calling convention** (`form-lower-callconv` — args marshalled into w0..w7 over an `ll-buffer` frame, then `bl`; `lo-marshal` scales with the arg list). The lever's frame is `ll-buffer`'s own alloc/free, so the convention composes the memory model — one engine, not parallel paths. **G3** (any recipe → native) and **G7** (form-cli compiles itself — self-host) are the path that opens from here. The roadmap rung-status is **manifest-derived** — `form_cli_roadmap.sh` reads each rung's proving band from `fourth-arm-bands.txt`, so the floor cannot claim what it has not proven.
- **Conviction codes are named constants** — `lc-wrong/lc-bloated/lc-healthy/lc-better`, not bare 0/1/2/3.
- **Confidence is one primitive** — `fcr-confidence-axis` (a lane's measured pass-rate) is the single definition; `form-cli-loop.fk`'s `fcl-confidence` delegates to it and `fcr-backend-learned` computes the router fitness axis from it, so the route gate and the fitness scalar share one notion of confidence. Both bands four-way (form-cli-loop → 31, form-cli-router → 31). Open wire: the python `ask` route still bypasses `fcr-route` with a coarse door.

**Known four-way divergence (hard gate, tracked):** the **TypeScript kernel computes 32-bit unsigned bitwise-multiply wrong** — FNV-1a-32 (`fnv.fk`) gives Go=Rust=fkwu=correct but TS=wrong, because JS numbers are float64 (exact only to 2⁵³, so `(h⊕b)*16777619` loses precision) and JS bitwise ops coerce to *signed* 32-bit (so `& 0xFFFFFFFF` returns negative for the high bit). The `fnv.fk` recipe is correct (three kernels prove it); the TS kernel's integer arithmetic is the bug. Per the divergence discipline this is **not shipped** — it blocks `fnv` → cache content-hash until the TS kernel does uint32 math faithfully (BigInt or `Math.imul`+`>>>0`). Fixing it hardens the four-way floor for *every* large-int Form recipe, not just FNV. The correct `fnv.fk` + band are preserved for the moment the TS fix lands.

The rework plan below keeps the remaining (mostly spine) items open and honest.

## Families, best → worst alignment

1. storage + ports — 88 (14/14 four-way, cleanest carrier-last; one misaligned cache.fk)
2. native asm/lower/4th-arm (the lever) — 86 (11/11 four-way, most north-star-coherent; altitude-only gaps + flt-bp-node placeholder)
3. learning — 82 (39/42 four-way; systematic stale headers, one unnamed 3-kernel claim)
4. protocol + offer — 82 (5/8 four-way, honest floor, axiom-5 disciplined; altitude + DRY)
5. form-cli core + cornerstones — 82 (17/19 four-way; raw-recipe altitude, unwired ask-route)
6. substrate — 74 (5/8 four-way; stale claims, cache trust split, no BML lift)
7. choice + backtrack — 72 (8/9 four-way; flat tuples, two tag conventions, one proof-theater row)
8. channel — 68 (13/23 four-way; form-os-channel now Form over storage-port; inert catalogs, flat rows)
9. http + net — 84 (5/8 four-way: kernel-http + http-render + http-parse + http-request + http-server cross; one duplicate engine (http-serve) to compost, http-adapter compat tissue, http-socket host-io)
10. host-os + IO + tool-channel — 62 (8/11 four-way; the host-OS kernel carriers are 3-kernel-only with the exact op named in-file, carrier drift remains)
11. BMF grammar engine — 58 (4/19 four-way; the principled cursor (bmf-core/bmf-grammar) crosses; 3+ parallel engines + stale claims remain)
12. BML + source-compiler — 58 (5/13 four-way; two BML front-ends, Go-only compiler tissue, output-not-compiler proof)

## North-star alignment — where the surface holds the line and where it drifts

WHERE THE SURFACE HOLDS THE LINE. The body genuinely embodies its north star in identifiable cornerstones. (1) Content-addressing is EXECUTED, not asserted: gematria/sanskrit/shamballa channels run node_eq class membership and recursive derivation; resource-port interns ports so (direction,value-shape) identity = substitutability; offers-in-flight makes the offer NodeID the concurrency primitive with no host-ported registry. (2) One-engine-cases-as-data is real where it matters: guidance-channel + channels-registry (one resolver, systems as rows), storage-port (backend-as-data, one substitutability test over memory/file/db), learning-style-space and geometric-learning (styles/biases as data), kernel-http's data-oblivious quantizer router. (3) Oracle-as-teacher is codified verbatim: lowering-conviction (semantic-equivalence the only hard gate, byte-identity only for encoders, smaller-than-oracle is a WIN), capability-form-asm (native MATCHES clang by execution exit-code then retires it). (4) Carrier-last holds in the strong families: oracle-ensure (brain-Form/hands-host-io), tool-channel (plans, never executes), the native-asm .sh files are named carriers only. (5) The lever works two ways: the AOT lever lowers a Form-recipe tree -> arm64/ELF/Mach-O bytes with zero clang (form-asm/form-lower/form-macho/form-elf -> recipe-dylib -> codesign), proven four-way including fkwu; and fkwu's OWN self-JIT (fkc-nat-expr, pure-compute tags 1-7,12) crystallizes hot functions to native at runtime and melts them on cool, champion-challenger re-earned (jit-lower, full-jit-lower, champion-challenger). 'Native speed' is therefore not a hand-written fast-path — it is what a proven Form recipe already becomes. ll-* leaves were self-authored by close-next via local oracle with zero remote tokens.

WHERE IT DRIFTS. (a) HIGHEST-GRAMMAR GAP is pervasive — almost the entire surface sits at raw Form-recipe (defn/if/list) when BML/domain-grammar is the highest available; structural-composition (typed records, TypedTokenRef, SEQUENCE) is met almost nowhere, so flat positional nth-tuples and string-eq tags are the body-wide norm. Only kernel-http, bml.fk, sovereign-boundary-protocol, and a few BML-authored ledgers reach the top tier. (b) CARRIER-AS-BODY: resource-port hardwires file IO inside drivers it promises are swappable — the remaining cell where the host call lives inside the swap point. (form-os-channel and kernel-image-proposal are Form recipes over their carriers — four-way, structure-asserted, with host emission generated from the recipe.) (c) HARDCODED SPECIAL-CASES / PLACEHOLDERS: flt-bp-node is a 31-arm hand-keyed NodeID table; form-ontology-loader hand-lists ~250 coordinates; tool-channel-grammar holds parse-phrases as inert doc-strings. (d) PROOF-THEATER: form-control-backtracking-ml's four-way row proves only 'return strings'; oracle-distillation fixtures carry invented magic numbers; channel-query's fingerprint docstring describes an unrun sha256-fold; roadmap.fk asserts 'done' with no evidence link; the BML compiler's COMPILED OUTPUT crossing four-way is presented as the COMPILER crossing (it runs Go-only). (e) FOUR-WAY HOLES on the most load-bearing cells: the host-OS kernel carriers (host-kernel-cell/kernel-satsang) are walled off fkwu on walk_recipe + the .fkb form-binary pair — a standing wall named in each file header, not a silent absence. (The principled BMF cursor crosses — bmf-core/bmf-grammar four-way incl. fkwu, intern_node_at lifted via the fourth-shim's content-addressed image.) (f) PARALLEL PATHS: two BML front-ends, 3+ grammar cursor engines, two HTTP servers, two cache trust axioms. The honest verdict: the body's IDEAS are north-star; its PROOF and ALTITUDE lag the ideas, and the lag is concentrated in the grammar/compiler/host-OS spine — the very cornerstones that should be strongest.
## Floor — what the manifest and headers owe reality

The manifest (form/fourth-arm-bands.txt, ~335 four-way rows) is the floor source and is largely accurate — but several concrete updates are owed so the body's self-attestation matches reality:

HOST-OS BANDS: the host-OS surface bands cross four-way — tool-channel-grammar (fks 255) and bml-capability-ledger (fks 255), both int/string/list ops the same family four-way tool-channel rides. Their kernel carriers are 3-kernel-only with the exact op named in each file header: host-kernel-cell and kernel-satsang on walk_recipe (execute an interned recipe) + write_form_binary/read_form_binary (.fkb host-io image) + node_children/node_value projections; kernel-core-self and kernel-core-image add broad BML source-scan + native_blueprint. The flattener has no flt-ops row for these, so fkwu lowers each to its literal-0 fallback (a degraded value, not a wrong computed one) — unsupported op families, standing walls, kept out of the manifest until those ops join the fourth arm. kernel-image-proposal (fks 111111) and form-os-channel (fks 111111) cross four-way as Form recipes over their carriers. The http server value stack is registered four-way: http-render (63), http-parse (11), http-request (63), http-server (1023). ADD ROWS still owed: substrate-phase (its primitives already cross as cache-phase's prelude).

FIX STALE UNDERSTATEMENTS (headers say 'three-way' while the manifest proves four-way — retune to match the floor): substrate-core.fk, memory-phases.fk, and 15 learning files (active-inference, classifier-eval, co-learning-stream, learned-primitive, nearest-shape, predictor-train, self-grounding-classifier, sequence-predictor, colearning-retire, learning-arc, predictor-sampling, trust-weighted-colearning, champion-challenger, learning-trend, metabolic-learning — verified on disk). Add the missing '; Proven by: ... (four-way)' line to autodiff-gradient.fk.

NAME THE HONEST 3-KERNEL BOUNDARIES IN-FILE (real unsupported-op walls, currently silent): embedding-as-recipe (node/substrate ops), learning-style-space (diagnose the higher-order-functions-in-data shape — either cross or name the exact op; this is the one UNNAMED 3-kernel claim that is a correctness/honesty gate), the channel/sanskrit/gematria/shamballa transport wrappers (their DECODER grammars are four-way; only the channel layer is 3-kernel by node/host-io family — never let the channel inherit the grammar's verdict), bmf-choice-receipts, and storage-port-db (pg_* Rust-only by design — already named).

DOWNGRADE THE SEMANTICALLY-VACUOUS ROW: form-control-backtracking-ml's 65535 four-way row proves only 'return a list of strings crosses four kernels' — either bind each named primitive to its proving band (verified index) or move to a .form north-star cell.

STOP DUPLICATING THE FLOOR: channel-protocol-choice-floor.fk hand-mirrors ~18 sibling 'proven-four-way' verdicts as string literals that can silently drift — derive status from fourth-arm-bands.txt instead. The real BMF cursor front-end crosses the fourth kernel (bands bmf-core, bmf-grammar) alongside the tokenwise fold — the principled grammar engine is provable on fkwu. The cornerstone host-OS inversion remains the standing four-way hole.
## Biggest cross-cutting gaps

- FOUR-WAY COVERAGE on the most load-bearing cells. The host-OS inversion's surface bands cross (kernel-image-proposal, tool-channel-grammar, bml-capability-ledger four-way registered); its kernel carriers (host-kernel-cell on kernel-satsang, kernel-core-self/image) are 3-kernel-only on the walk_recipe + .fkb form-binary + broad-source-scan walls, with the exact op family named in each header — no longer silently absent. The real BMF front end (bmf-core/bmf-grammar g-parse cursor) crosses the fourth arm: the char_at/ord cursor rides the shim string stones, the parse emits universal recipes through the content-addressed intern arm, and intern_node_at rides the shim image of intern_node (same returned NodeID, attribution feeds only the framebuffer the verdict never reads). The http server value stack (http-parse, http-request, http-render, http-server) crosses four-way: http-parse emits the request's parts as kh-header values directly, so http-request lifts them into kh-request with no substrate-node detour, and the whole flow walks one vocabulary.
- PARALLEL PATHS / TWO ENGINES. BML has two front-ends (the principled bml.fk grammar vs a ~500-line hand-rolled string scanner in source-compiler.fk that the build actually runs — Go-only). The grammar family has at least three cursor/matcher engines (bmf-core/bmf-grammar, form-parse, grammar-chars) plus engine.fk under bmf-choice-receipts/runtime-grammar, and per-language lifters re-implement precedence climbing bmf-grammar already carries as data. http + net carries a superseded second server engine (http-serve.fk) on life-support with three live bands. storage has two cache files (cache.fk vs cache-phase.fk) that DISAGREE on the trust axiom.
- GRAMMAR ALTITUDE GAP — almost nothing is at the highest available grammar. The learning family (42 files), choice+backtrack (9), substrate (8), storage+ports (14), native-asm (11), and form-cli-core (19) are ALL uniformly raw Form-recipe (defn/if/list) when BML/domain-grammar is available; the structural-composition discipline (typed records, NamedField, TypedTokenRef, SEQUENCE) is met almost nowhere — flat positional nth-tuples and stringly-typed tags are the family-wide norm.
- PROOF-THEATER AND STALE PROOF CLAIMS. form-control-backtracking-ml returns string-LISTS naming choose/fail/cut and carries a four-way row (65535) that proves only 'return strings crosses four kernels'. SYSTEMATIC stale headers: 15 learning files + substrate-core + memory-phases say 'three-way at validate.sh' while the manifest proves them four-way (understatement drift). channel-protocol-choice-floor hand-mirrors ~18 sibling 'proven-four-way' verdicts as drift-prone string literals and freezes a per-agent validation-round journey-log. channel-query's cq-query-fingerprint docstring promises a sha256-fold the body (return node_inst) never runs.
- CARRIER-AS-BODY DRIFT. resource-port hardwires write_file_text/read_file inside its drivers despite a header promising swappable carriers — the remaining cell where a host call lives inside what claims to be the swap point. (form-os-channel and kernel-image-proposal are Form recipes over their carriers: the channel logic crosses four-way over the storage-port memory carrier with sqlite as an honest host-io carrier whose C is generated from the schema recipe; the proposal is a tagged value serialized once by the kernel-http response carrier, asserted on structure.)
- HARDCODED PLACEHOLDERS. form-flatten's flt-bp-node is a 31-arm hand-keyed literal NodeID table self-admitted as 'follow-on lift'. jit-tensor-emit assembles kernels as ~60-deep str_concat ladders. roadmap.fk asserts G0..G7 'done'/'open' with no link to evidence — it can claim done for something that regressed.
- DUPLICATED / UNWIRED VOCABULARY AND LOGIC. The four membrane surfaces are copied verbatim into form-cli-sample; teacher-state strings ('installed'/'source-pending'/'absent') are triplicated across gaps/oracle-ensure/oracle-catalog; int->string is re-rolled in 9+ stdlib files; SQL escape/contains helpers re-rolled across four storage carriers; a covers+covers double-walk majority idiom recurs across predict/score/judge/review-gap. The python `ask` route (form_cli.py:1025) does NOT call the four-axis fcr-route — a latent second router. trust/confidence notions exist twice in form-cli (router axis vs loop fcl-confidence) without one folding into the other.

## Open rework plan (the cornerstone investment)

### [HIGH] Wire the four-axis router and confidence/trust as the SOLE decision path; fold the duplicate confidence notion

- **Why:** UNWIRED TRUST. form-cli-router carries the one fitness formula over sovereignty/trust/capability/confidence with weights-as-data — exactly right — but the python `ask` route (form_cli.py:1025) bypasses it with a coarse library-has-it-else-oracle door, and form-cli-loop's fcl-confidence is a second 0..100 confidence notion that never folds into the router's confidence axis. Trust/confidence is computed but not the actual gate at the live carrier.
- **Action:** Make the python `ask` route call fcr-route (or its native runner equivalent) so the four-axis formula is the only router; unify fcl-confidence with the router's confidence axis into one confidence primitive feeding both the gate and the fitness scalar.

### [FLOOR] The 7 host-os bands each stand four-way-registered or 3-kernel-only with the exact op named

- **Shape:** Each of host-kernel-cell, kernel-satsang, kernel-core-self, kernel-core-image, kernel-image-proposal, tool-channel-grammar, and bml-capability-ledger is probed on the fourth arm. THREE cross and are registered (kernel-image-proposal fks 11111, tool-channel-grammar fks 255, bml-capability-ledger fks 255) — int/string/list family, 0 divergent. FOUR are 3-kernel-only on a real unsupported op family, named in each header: host-kernel-cell and kernel-satsang on walk_recipe + write/read_form_binary (kernel-satsang also node_children/node_value over a fresh image); kernel-core-self and kernel-core-image on broad BML source-scan host-io + walk_recipe/native_blueprint + the form-binary pair. The carried node/substrate floor (intern_node, node_eq, node_category, intern_trivial_int/string, bp) crosses; the flattener has no flt-ops row for the walled ops, so fkwu answers a literal-0-degraded value — a standing wall, not a divergence. Commit evidence: docs/system_audit/commit_evidence_20260618_host_os_fourth_arm_bands.json.
- **Remaining toward the native ideal:** host-kernel-cell/kernel-satsang/kernel-core-self/image cross when walk_recipe, the interned-node projections, the broad source-scan, and the form-binary carrier join the fourth arm; the proof files use the *-proof.fk convention and become *-band.fk when their ops cross.

### [FLOOR] The real BMF cursor (bmf-core/bmf-grammar g-parse) is on the fourth arm

- **Shape:** The strongest north-star realization in the audit — one data-driven matcher, grammars-as-data, parsing-produces-recipes, no-sediment backtracking — is four-way proven incl. fkwu (bands bmf-core verdict 600, bmf-grammar verdict 300, 0 divergent). The string cursor's char_at/ord/substring ride the shim string stones (tags 24..29); the parse emits universal recipes through the content-addressed intern arm (intern_node tag 47, bp tag 45, trivial interns tags 43/46, make_nodeid tag 91). bmf-grammar's `intern_node_at` rides a fourth-shim image: `(defn intern_node_at (cat kids file line col) (intern_node cat kids))` — the returned NodeID is exactly the content-addressed intern, and the file/line/col attribution feeds only the framebuffer side-map, observer-side metadata no band verdict reads. This carries the BMF/dialect surface (bmf-core, bmf-grammar, bmf-to-fk, http-parse, the evals) toward provable; bmf-mini carries the grammar-swap bands (jit-lower-bmf / fourth-union / language-packs-fourth).

### [HIGH] Re-ground cache.fk on content-hash trust and the roadmap on real evidence; honor lowering-conviction's gate distinction everywhere

- **Why:** lowering-conviction.fk is the clearest north-star cell — it codifies oracle-as-teacher: semantic-equivalence is the only hard gate, byte-identity ONLY for the encoder where one right answer exists, smaller/faster than the oracle is a WIN. But cache.fk trusts MTIME while its sibling cache-phase.fk explicitly teaches mtime-trust is wrong and content-hash is right (two cache files in one family disagreeing on the trust axiom, and cache.fk is the unproven one). roadmap.fk asserts 'done'/'open' with no link to ground truth — it can claim done for something that regressed.
- **Action:** Re-ground cache-fresh? on input-hash equality (cache.fk:33-39) and add a four-way band; derive roadmap step status from manifest rows / band presence instead of hand-edited literals; name lowering-conviction's four verdict codes (wrong/bloated/healthy/better) as constants so callers stop comparing bare 0/1/2/3.

### [FLOOR] Carrier-not-body: form-os-channel and kernel-image-proposal are Form/BML recipes over existing carriers

- **Shape:** form-os-channel is a Form recipe — the schema (three composed relation kinds), the four verbs (init/state/offer/validate), and the offer/acknowledge lifecycle (offer-lane's axiom-5 OFFERED→GROUNDED ack) run over the storage-port contract; the SAME logic crosses four-way over the memory carrier (form-os-channel fks 111111) while sqlite/file are honest host-io carriers, and the table DDL the sqlite carrier needs is generated from the schema recipe (foc-emit-create) so there is one source and no baked divergence string. kernel-image-proposal is a tagged value tree over kernel-http's vocabulary — candidate image / mutation gate / trust envelope as nested tagged cells over kh-field rows — serialized once by the http-render response carrier (kh-serve-response); every assertion reads structure (kh-tagged?, kh-field-value-or, accessor children, kh-response-status), four-way (kernel-image-proposal fks 111111).
- **Remaining carrier-as-body:** resource-port hardwires file IO inside its swappable drivers (its own item).

### [HIGH] Resolve oracle-ensure / oracle-distillation proof grounding: drive native-vs-oracle gates over REAL captured corpus, not fixtures

- **Why:** oracle-ensure.fk is exemplary brain-Form/hands-host-io separation — keep its shape. But oracle-distillation-learning's odl-*-receipt fixtures (lines 226-295) are invented magic numbers (token 900/160, quality 88/84) and the 'native beats oracle' gate runs over them — a proof-theater gap. oracle-distill-corpus.fk already holds MEASURED 949-turn held-out counts and is the right exemplar. form-cli-model is a hand-frozen data cell with no band proving it matches the trainer's current output.
- **Action:** Drive odl-native-wins?/odl-c-ready? over real io-match / native-training-receipt rows (the oracle-distill-corpus pattern), move prose floor/north-star lists out of executable code; add a band that diffs form_cli_train_predict.sh output against the form-cli-model data cell so a stale model is caught. Single-source teacher-state strings across oracle-ensure/gaps/oracle-catalog.

### [MED] Collapse the duplicate engines: one BML front-end, one cursor engine, one HTTP server

- **Why:** Parallel paths violate the one-engine north star in three families at once. BML: bml.fk grammar vs the ~500-line hand-rolled scanner in source-compiler.fk that the build actually runs (Go-only, so neither front-end is four-way-proven as executing tissue — the proof-theater is the COMPILED OUTPUT crossing four-way being presented as the compiler crossing). Grammar: 3+ cursor/matcher engines + engine.fk. http: a superseded http-serve.fk on life-support with three live bands.
- **Action:** Delete the source-compiler.fk fsc-compile-form-bml-* scanner and drive form-source-compile through bml.fk+engine.fk to one Recipe tree; converge form-parse + grammar-chars onto bmf-grammar g-match (add not/peek/cut/multi-match/eol as data tags); compost http-serve.fk after moving its unique http-fanout relay into kh-serve.

### [FLOOR] http-parse emits request parts as kh-header values directly (no substrate node detour) — server value stack four-way

- **Shape:** http-parse is the BML lexer: it walks the wire bytes into the request's PARTS (method, full path, kh-header list, body) as plain values, interning nothing. http-request lifts those parts into kh-request (path/query split, query → kh-field). There is no intern_node/node_category wall in the value path, so the whole server stack walks one vocabulary. http-render-band, http-parse-band, http-request-band, and http-server-band are registered four-way (63 / 11 / 63 / 1023). http-serve reads the same lexer parts + kernel-http's kh-header-value-or, sharing the ascii-lower/header-value-ci helpers, and stays three-kernel only for its socket host-io. The fourth-arm stem resolver anchors to form-stdlib/tests/ so a same-named sample (cross-modal 34-http-parse) cannot collide with a manifest band.
- **Remaining in family:** compost http-serve (a second engine), move its fan-out relay into kh-serve; track http-adapter's alist bridge as a closing compat recipe.

### [MED] Generate flt-bp-node and the form-ontology-loader name-list from the shared BP table; lift jit-tensor-emit string assembly to a template grammar

- **Why:** form-flatten's flt-bp-node is a 31-arm hand-keyed literal NodeID table — the native-asm family's ONLY true admitted placeholder, the one spot where fkwu's NodeID identity is hand-keyed not derived. form-ontology-loader hand-lists ~250 dialect-binding coordinates as a string mega-literal. jit-tensor-emit assembles model kernels as ~60-deep str_concat ladders (correct but inert carrier tissue).
- **Action:** Generate flt-bp-node and the form-ontology-loader dialect-binding list + engine-constant rows from the SAME generator that emits the kernel bp table (one source of truth); introduce a small emit/template grammar with named holes (el/ac/fname) for jit-tensor-emit kernel bodies.

### [MED] Resolve form-control-backtracking-ml proof-theater and the stale/duplicated proof claims across the body

- **Why:** form-control-backtracking-ml returns string-lists naming choose/fail/cut and carries a four-way row (65535) that proves nothing about backtracking — an unproven claim dressed as covered coverage. 15 learning files + substrate-core + memory-phases carry stale 'three-way' headers while proven four-way. channel-protocol-choice-floor hand-mirrors ~18 'proven-four-way' verdicts (drift) and freezes a journey-log. channel-query's fingerprint docstring overclaims.
- **Action:** Bind each named backtracking primitive to the band that proves it runs four-way (verified index) or move the prose to a .form north-star cell; sweep the 'three-way'->'four-way' headers; derive channel-protocol-choice-floor status from fourth-arm-bands.txt and compost its validation-round log; fix or rewrite cq-query-fingerprint.

### [LOW] Core-lift the duplicated low-level helpers and the covers+covers majority idiom into shared cells

- **Why:** int->string is re-rolled in 9+ stdlib files (the '0123456789' substring trick); SQL escape/quote/contains? re-rolled across cell-log-store/graph-node-port/application-graph-node-port/storage-port-db (headers admit it); a covers+covers double-walk majority idiom recurs across predict/score/judge/review-gap. This is the exact 'repeated low-level shape wants to become a reusable teaching' the core-lift north-star names.
- **Action:** Add one int->str and one parse-int/contains?/escape codec module to core.fk and prelude it from every carrier; add a single-walk majority?/ge2x helper and replace the covers+covers idiom everywhere.

### [LOW] Lift flat positional tuples + stringly-typed tags to typed composites family-wide, starting with choice-receipt

- **Why:** The structural-composition discipline (compose, never flat; TypedTokenRef capabilities) is met almost nowhere: flat nth-tuples and string-eq tags are the norm across learning, choice, channel, storage, protocol, host-os. choice-receipt.fk is the keystone every other choice file accessors-through; lifting it raises the family and turns documented content-addressing into enforced content-addressing. Two tag conventions (integer CR-TAG vs string literals) coexist inside the choice family.
- **Action:** Lift choice-receipt's record family (and branch-choice-order / choice-outcome-learning tuples) to BML typed records with integer Blueprint tags bound to user-blueprint-registry.md cell-refs; promote tc-tool/tc-protocol capabilities to TypedTokenRef so an unknown capability is unrepresentable; unify the choice family on one tag convention.
