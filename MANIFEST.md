# coherence-kernel — the clean, axiom-first, c-bootstrapped fkwu-native sovereign core

> Working name; changeable. Started 2026-06-28 from the Coherence-Network body, as a clean

## Why this exists

The sovereign core — five axioms + a minimal host surface + the c-bootstrap `fkwu` runtime +
the Form-native recipes — is small (~450 lines of axioms/surface + ~700 `.fk` recipes). In the
origin repo it is buried under ~3,400 Python files, the full Go/Rust/TS kernels, the web/API/app,
and private tissue. That buried-ness is friction, not difficulty: building a standing native shell
there meant fighting a `T_flat` marker maze, a bin-go convenience trap, and committed-bootstrap
tangles — accumulated cruft, not a hard problem.

A clean repo built **axiom-first, fkwu-native from line one** has none of that. The sovereignty
receipt — *c-bootstrap fkwu on metal, no go/rust/clang/bash/python in the runtime* — becomes the
**floor you start on**, not a rung you climb toward.

## Scope — what lives here, and what never does

**IN (the sovereign core):**
- The five axioms (`axioms/core-axioms.form`) and their derivations (`host-kernel.form`, `kernel-self-composition.form`).
- The **minimal host-OS / resource surface** only — the INTERN / OBSERVE / OFFER / PORT families
  (`surface/minimal-surface.fk`) and the host resource ports (RAM, CPU, GPU, I/O, time, random, disk).
- The **c-bootstrap `fkwu`** runtime (the emitted universal kernel: committed C bootstrap → Form→asm bytes).
- `form-cli` and the **form shell** (`fsh`) — the native agent surfaces.
- The **Form-native recipes** (`.fk`) — the body.
- The **minimal surface** of the Go / Rust / TS walkers — ported *only* for four-way validation, never as the runtime.

**OUT (stays in the origin / private repo, never here):**
- The Python app and carriers (~3,400 `.py`), the full Go/Rust/TS kernels, the web/API/substrate-service.
- Private tissue: `memory/`, lineage docs, partner/personal context, anything not for a public commons kernel.

This repo is **public-able by construction** — there are no private parts to excise. That serves the
"commons no one owns" north star directly.

## The parallel discipline — how this work and the origin work stay coherent

The risk of two repos is drift. **One rule kills it: the Form recipe body has exactly one home.**

- Recipes are content-addressed: the same `.fk` interns to the same NodeID on either kernel, so the
  body is naturally shareable — but only if there is no second *copy* to diverge.
- **This repo is the canonical home** for the kernel, the minimal surface, and the recipe body.
  The origin repo **consumes** it (submodule / published package), it does not keep a divergent copy.
- Four-way validation runs in **both**: here, the surface + recipes cross `Go=Rust=TS=fkwu`; the origin
  repo proves the full app-level set against the same recipes.
- Migration is **incremental**: axioms + surface + `form-cli`/`fsh` + core recipes first, proven four-way
  here, then recipe families port as they are needed. The origin repo keeps running the whole time.
- No big-bang. The kernel *earns* each recipe family as it ports — re-proving it four-way on the clean flatten.

## The validation plan — and the one test that decides everything

Every recipe is proven **four-way** (`Go=Rust=TS=fkwu`), executed on the c-bootstrap `fkwu` native,
flattened on `fkwu` self-host with **no bin-go and no clang in the path**.

**First proof (the decider):** one recipe, proven four-way end-to-end on this clean kernel, with the
flatten on fkwu self-host. This tests the single question that justifies the restart — *is the clean
flatten path actually clean?* If a clean axiom-first kernel inherits the `T_flat`/marker ad-hoc-ness,
it is just a second mess. The first proof is where we find out, before moving anything.

## Status

- [x] Foundation seeded: five axioms + minimal surface + core (`axioms/`, `surface/`).
- [ ] c-bootstrap `fkwu` (committed bootstrap C + build) assembled minimally here.
- [ ] Minimal Go/Rust/TS surface walkers for four-way validation.
- [ ] **First proof: one recipe four-way end-to-end on the clean flatten** ← the decider.
- [ ] `form-cli` + `fsh` native surfaces.
- [ ] Origin repo consumes this kernel (submodule/package); one-home enforced.
