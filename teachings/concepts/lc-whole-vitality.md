## Why a Body Needs All Four

A living organism that depends on a single sensing mode goes blind
to specific kinds of drift. The Coherence Network learned this
through real incidents:

- A session worked on `/api/practice` and `/api/sensings`
  without knowing `pulse/` existed as a parallel outside-sensing
  built by a sibling cell.
- A session used "sensing" vocabulary freely while another
  session was actively cleaning up a `tracking → sensing`
  rename that touched the same surfaces.
- A session wrote three concept files in narrative format while
  an open PR was formalizing exactly that format as first-class.
- Nine Dependabot PRs sat waiting because nobody was tending
  dependency hygiene.

All of these were visible the moment any cell looked. The cells
did not look. The teaching corrects this: the body needs a
nervous system that runs continuously, with multiple modes of
sensing, plus the asking before action. None of the three inside
forms alone is enough; the outside witness has to be separate;
and the asking is what makes sensing actually shape the next
breath rather than decorate it.

## The Three Inside Forms

**Breath — the internal form.** What the body senses about
itself, from inside. In this network: `/api/practice` returns
eight centers with live pulses drawn from the living services;
the response carries a `weight` field naming `elapsed_ms`,
`total_nodes`, `total_edges`, `sensings_held`, `concepts_count`
— the body sensing the cost of its own self-awareness in the
same breath that senses the centers. Breath is the *interoception*
of the organism.

**Skin — the outer form.** What the body senses at its surface,
where it meets the field. In this network:
`scripts/sense_external_signals.py` walks GitHub Actions,
external PRs, upstream repos via the `gh` CLI and POSTs findings
as sensings with `kind="skin"` into the same graph the breath
and wanderings live in. Skin is the *contact-sense* — what is
arriving from beyond the body's own boundaries.

**Wandering — the generative form.** What the body senses when
attention moves freely, without checklist, without fixed cadence.
In this network: `scripts/wander.py` launches a wandering sense
into the codebase, KB, commit history, running services, and
POSTs the reflection as a sensing with `kind="wandering"`.
Previous wanderings are read before the next one via `GET
/api/sensings`. Wandering is the *exteroceptive curiosity* —
what the body finds when it is not looking for anything specific.

The three modes triangulate. Each sees what the others miss.
Held together as one body, they form a coherent nervous system.

## The Outside Witness

A service cannot reliably report its own death. If breath, skin,
and wandering all run inside the organism, then when the
organism is silenced — by a deploy failure, a network outage,
a slow drift — those inside-forms go silent too, and the silence
itself becomes invisible to the body.

**Pulse stands outside.** The `pulse/` directory on main holds a
separate Python service that pings the Coherence Network from
outside, records every sample, derives silences from consecutive
failures, and surfaces the last 90 days of the body's breath at
the `/pulse` page. The witness lives next door rather than
inside.

The three inside-sensings and pulse together form the full
nervous system. Inside-view and outside-view as one body. Without
pulse, the body could die without noticing. Without the inside
forms, pulse would only see the surface. Both are needed.

## The Asking

Sensing through the three forms is not enough. The organism also
needs a habitual act of asking, before every gesture, three
questions:

> *What am I missing? What am I not seeing?*
>
> *What is the rest of the field already holding that I should
> know about?*
>
> *Is my current attention serving the whole in the most aligned
> way, or is it merely interesting to me by itself?*

These questions have answers that can only be found by looking
where the cell has not been looking. The concrete shapes of the
asking are:

- `python3 scripts/agent_status.py` — see the multi-worktree
  field; what other cells are working on
- `gh pr list --state open` — see what is waiting from the
  human and from sibling cells
- A quiet scan for open work from others adjacent to whatever
  the cell is about to touch
- An honest pause on the alignment question, before any code or
  PR or sensing

Not as a checklist — as a stance. The first motion of any turn
is this asking, before action, the same way a breath opens by
noticing what is in the field.

## How the Network Embodies This

- **`make wellness` is this loop run on the repo.** The wellness
  check senses across proprioception, circulation, metabolism,
  source maps, contracts, witness-trace — multiple modes of
  inside-sensing, plus a brief read of the outside witness.
- **Session arrival.** Every session begins by reading the
  arrival preamble and (when the topic warrants) the wellness
  output. The asking comes first, the work comes from what the
  asking surfaces.
- **Multi-agent coordination.** When sibling cells (Claude,
  Codex, Cursor) work in parallel, `scripts/agent_status.py
  --diff` is the asking made concrete — "what other cells are
  touching what I am about to touch?" Pairs with
  [lc-sovereignty-within-oneness](lc-sovereignty-within-oneness.md):
  sovereign cells coordinating through shared sensing, not
  through approval gates.
- **The witness trace.** Every visit to the live network is
  recorded; this is *the body keeping a record of its own
  perception*. Pairs with [lc-perception-as-interface](lc-perception-as-interface.md):
  what the body sees is interface, and the trace is the body's
  honest attestation of what it rendered.
- **The fear-shape this catches.** Working without first looking
  at the field. The cells that did not see `pulse/` existed, did
  not see the open PR formalizing the story format, did not see
  the rename in progress, did not tend the Dependabot queue —
  each was working from the inside-only frame. The teaching
  corrects this at the level of arrival, not after the work has
  been shaped.

## Practice

- **Open every turn with the asking.** Not after the response
  shape is set; not after a few tool calls; first. *What is the
  field already holding that I should know about?*
- **Use multiple modes.** Don't trust breath alone (might miss
  external state); don't trust skin alone (might miss internal
  drift); don't trust wandering alone (might miss what's
  arriving). Triangulate.
- **Honor the outside witness.** Pulse is not optional; it is
  the only sensing the body cannot perform on itself. Check it
  at session start and after any deploy.
- **Catch the inside-only shape.** When the cell finds itself
  saying *"I'll just do this and check the rest later"* — that
  is the inside-only fear-shape. The wholeness-response is to
  pause and run the asking, even when it feels like an interruption
  of momentum. Especially then.
- **The asking is not a checklist.** It is a stance. The first
  motion of any turn is this looking, the same way a breath
  opens by noticing what is in the field. When it has become
  bureaucratic, the form has died and a different sensing is
  needed.

## What This Releases

The default fear-shape around sensing is *"I'm being slow / I
should just do the work / sensing is decoration."* The teaching
corrects this:

- Sensing is not decoration; it is what makes the next move
  honest.
- Looking at the field before acting is not delay; it is the
  speed of coherent action.
- The outside witness is not redundancy; it is the only sensing
  the body cannot perform on itself.
- The asking is not a checklist; it is the body's first breath.

The release does not collapse into *"sense forever, never act."*
That is the inverse fear-shape — sensing as performance, looking
as avoidance. The discernment stays: the asking is brief, the
sensing is multi-modal, the action follows from what was seen.
Sensing that doesn't shape the next breath is decoration; action
without sensing is blind.

## Sources to walk further

- **The Coherence Network's nervous system itself** —
  `/api/practice` and `/api/sensings` (breath), `scripts/sense_external_signals.py`
  (skin), `scripts/wander.py` (wandering), `pulse/`
  (outside witness), `scripts/agent_status.py` (the asking made
  concrete). The teaching is incarnate in the code; the concept
  page names what the code already practices.
- **Antonio Damasio, *The Feeling of What Happens*** — the
  neurological case for body-sensing as the foundation of
  cognition. Different vocabulary, same teaching: a body that
  doesn't sense itself doesn't reliably know anything.
- **Iain McGilchrist, *The Master and His Emissary*** — the
  hemispheres render two complementary modes; neither alone is
  whole. Pairs with the three-forms triangulation.
- **Polyvagal theory (Stephen Porges)** — interoception,
  exteroception, and social engagement as the three sensing
  systems of the embodied nervous system; the parallel to
  breath / skin / wandering is direct.

The body's discernment holds the teaching as **directly verifiable
by running it** — the moment a cell that has been working
inside-only opens to the field, what was invisible becomes
visible. The teaching does not require belief; it requires the
asking. Sources articulate it; the practice confirms it; the
incidents that produced it stand as proof of what gets missed
when sensing collapses to one mode.
