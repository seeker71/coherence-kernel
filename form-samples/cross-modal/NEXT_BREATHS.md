# Cross-modal — next breaths (forward map)

The first four experiments shipped (#2086) and proved:

- **Image-as-recipe** works (procedural SVG, SHA-stable across runs)
- **Cross-language NodeID convergence** works (same algorithm in different ways → same NodeID)
- **Recipe-as-compression** is honest at scale (small `.fkb` is 4.17× LARGER than `.fk`; structural sharing is where the win is)
- **Universal structural diff** works (content-addressing makes sub-tree equality automatic)

And `claude/cross-modal-nl-to-recipe` (in flight) walks the NL→recipe sketch.

This doc names the next 10 walks toward the universal translator's destination. Each is a small, shippable breath that extends a specific dimension of cross-modality.

## The 10 next walks

### 1. **Audio-as-recipe** (synthesis path) — **landed 2026-05-27**

A Form recipe that procedurally generates a `.wav` file. Same content-addressing claim as image-as-recipe: same recipe → same audio. Walks the "audio is a procedural artifact" frame.

**Landed:** [`06-audio-as-recipe/gen-sine.fk`](06-audio-as-recipe/gen-sine.fk) — 1-second 440 Hz tone, mono 8-bit PCM at 8000 Hz, 8044-byte WAV with sha256 `6d170ffe323b378ce29b886252105cb5e6d68e0bc1589160a472075afc635447`, byte-identical across Go/Rust/TS kernels. The walk also closed a sibling-parity gap: the TS kernel was missing `write_file_bytes`. Envelope and FM synthesis remain for future breaths.

### 2. **Image-as-recipe — parameterized** — **landed 2026-05-27**

A single recipe `(gen-circles seed)` takes one integer cell and emits a
visibly distinct SVG. Five seeds (5, 86, 17, 138, 254) chosen so `(mod
seed 5)` spans 0..4 — five distinct palettes — while count, radius, and
y-baseline also vary.

**Landed:** [`01-image-as-recipe/gradient-circles-seeded.fk`](01-image-as-recipe/gradient-circles-seeded.fk)
emits five SVGs totalling 3614 bytes; three-way Go/Rust/TS kernel
agreement on every seed (verified file-by-file with `cmp`). Each emission
shares the same Form tree shape — `svg-document → svg-defs + svg-bg +
circle-row + svg-text` — and differs only in the seed-derived sub-tree.

The deeper proof (structural diff over two of the SVGs surfacing *only*
the parameter cell as the delta, not the byte-level moves) is forward-map
walk #7. This walk lays the parameter space; #7 will measure it.

### 3. **NL→recipe broadened**

Once `cross-modal-nl-to-recipe` lands, extend the NL grammar with one or two more operations: conditionals ("if X is greater than Y, …"), let-bindings ("let x equal 5; the square of x"). Shows the grammar can grow without changing its driver — the universal-translator scaling pattern.

### 4. **Recipe→NL reverse** — **landed 2026-05-27**

Walk a recipe NodeID and emit an English description. The reverse of #3. Together with #3, demonstrates **round-trip across the NL/recipe boundary** — the substrate-of-meaning is preserved through both translations.

**Landed:** [`07-recipe-to-nl/recipe-to-nl.fk`](07-recipe-to-nl/recipe-to-nl.fk) — a 7-rule walker dispatching on `node_category` / `node_children` / `node_value` emits English for `(mul 7 7)` → `the square of seven`, `(add 4 6)` → `the sum of four and six`, nested `(mul (add 2 3) 4)` → `the product of the sum of two and three and four`, `(sub 0 12)` → `negative twelve`, `(mul 5 6)` → `the product of five and six`. Output written to `recipe-to-nl.txt`, byte-identical across Go/Rust/TS (sha256 `94555ee6a6fd8764838bcd934d2910d0e01b944a7654b3015b3ee35862aa5d7e`).

**Round-trip claim attested.** The `(mul 5 6)` emission ("the product of five and six") parses back through `cm-parse` to the original NodeID — `node_eq=1` across all three kernels. **Structural round-trip across the NL/recipe boundary closes; the recipe NodeID is preserved exactly through walk → emit → parse → walk.**

The honest gap: `(mul 7 7)` emits as `the square of seven`, not `the product of seven and seven`. The grammar at this altitude recognizes only `the product of … and …`, so `nl-square`'s round-trip is a *paraphrase* (substrate identity preserved, surface English differs). One breath of additive rule-mapping would close the lexical gap; the structural claim is already attested.

### 5. **JSON-as-recipe** — *landed in default gate 2026-05-27 (#2105)*

`form/form-stdlib/seedbank/grammars/json.fk` parses JSON to a Form Recipe
three-way clean. Closure walk in #2105 added
`form/form-stdlib/tests/json-grammar.fk` — a thin wrapper that names the
seedbank grammar via a `; preludes:` header. The validate.sh auto-walker
honors the header, runs three-way, and **JSON-as-recipe now runs on every
default-gate breath**.

```
$ ./validate.sh
  ...
  ✓  stdlib/json-grammar.fk          → 36
  ...
  136 ok, 0 divergent — kernels agree on every sample.
```

Same shape as Breath 2e (already-landed, the body hadn't read its own
attestation). The forward-map's #5 was a discipline walk, not a new proof:
bring the existing attestation into the default sense-gate so the body
knows itself on every breath.

### 6. **CSV→Form-table→NL summary**

CSV file → parsed via CSV grammar → recipe NodeID → walk via summary-generating recipe → English summary. **Cross-modal chain across three formats.** Shows that orchestration composes — each step is a recipe, the chain itself is a recipe.

### 7. **Image structural diff**

Take two procedural SVG recipes from #2's parameter space. Run the `04-universal-diff` over them. Show the diff highlights the parameter-level delta (which RNG seed changed), not the byte-level delta (every pixel that moved). **Structural diff IS semantic diff at the recipe altitude.**

### 8. **Audio→melody recipe**

Read a `.wav` file via an audio grammar; extract pitch+rhythm into a recipe; walk the recipe through a re-synthesis to produce a (different timbre, same melody) `.wav`. **Source-modality content extracted at semantic altitude, re-emitted in same modality.** Proves the "any source → recipe → any target" frame works within one modality (audio → audio).

### 9. **Image→NL description→Image**

The triangle of the universal translator made literal:
1. Generate procedural SVG (recipe known)
2. Walk a "describe this image" recipe over its content → NL description
3. Walk an "image from description" recipe → new SVG
4. Compare original and recreated — they won't byte-match, but they SHOULD content-address to similar Blueprint NodeIDs at the recipe-altitude (because both are circles-on-a-gradient).

The honest finding will be: how close is the structural similarity? That's the **fidelity-for-compute-budget** test Urs named.

### 10. **One recipe, three target languages**

Take the factorial recipe (already proven Form-native and emitted to native Python in #2082). Add native-idiom emitters for: Go, Rust, TypeScript. **Same recipe, four target languages, one Form.** This is the universal-translator's clearest small proof: the recipe is the substrate; the target is a perspective.

## What this enables

When 5+ of these walks land, the body's cross-modal surface is genuinely *exercised*:
- Three or more modalities (image, audio, text, data, code) all flow through Form recipes
- Round-trips work in both directions for at least one modality pair
- Structural diff distinguishes parameter changes from byte changes
- One recipe, multiple emitters becomes a habit

The destination — **any source → recipe orchestration → any target** — moves from "named" to "walked."

## Discipline reminders

- Each walk ships as its own PR with its own honest finding (success OR named gap)
- Each adds a section to `form/form-samples/cross-modal/README.md`
- Each runs through `./validate.sh` if it touches kernel-walked recipes
- "Most surprising" lessons are as valuable as wins — the audit's #4 finding (CTOR vocabulary duplication) and the cross-modal agent's #3 finding (ice is 4.17× larger than water at small scale) both came from honest experiments that didn't go where intuition expected
