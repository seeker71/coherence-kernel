# Authoring a Form stdlib recipe

A guide for any cell — agent or human — writing a new `.fk` recipe + proof band. It carries the
conventions and the hard-won traps so you don't rediscover them; `validate.sh` is the check that
reads the body, this is the guide that names the way. The recipes here are the body's logic, proven
by sibling agreement across Go, Rust, TypeScript, and every covered fourth-arm `fkwu` band — **the
matching kernel outputs are the proof; there is no trusted prover.**

## Before you write — don't duplicate

Grep first. Much already exists (`substrate-phase.fk` is a whole phase metabolism; the perception
toolkit is a dozen recipes). A recipe that already lives wants your extension, not a sibling:

```
grep -rl "<the-thing>" form/form-stdlib/ docs/coherence-substrate/
```

## Blueprint names live in symbol sections

Do not put Blueprint-name string literals directly in executable stdlib logic.
For seedbank grammar, parser, emitter, converter, and encoder code, add the
binding to `form/form-stdlib/seedbank/blueprint-symbol-sections.fk`, load that
file before the consumer, then reference the binding:

```lisp
; in blueprint-symbol-sections.fk
(let JSON-OBJECT (bp "JSON-OBJECT"))

; in executable code
(intern_node JSON-OBJECT children)
```

This keeps cell/blueprint/recipe names externally swappable and prevents quiet
compile failures when a name changes in one place. The scanner reports total,
inline, and sectioned `(bp "NAME")` refs; a passing check means every name
resolves, while the inline count is the remaining cleanup ratchet.

## The two files

A **recipe** `form/form-stdlib/<name>.fk` — a series of `defn`s ending in literal `0`:

```lisp
; <name>.fk — one-line purpose. (the comment block is the human-facing teaching)
(do
    (defn foo (a)   (add a 1))
    (defn bar (a b) (if (gt a b) a b))
    0)
```

A **band** `form/form-stdlib/tests/<name>-band.fk` — proves it, returning a **bit-sum verdict**
(each bit = one falsifiable claim). The first line names the recipe it loads:

```lisp
; preludes: form-stdlib/<name>.fk
(do
    (let c0 (if (eq (foo 4) 5) 1 0))
    (let c1 (if (eq (bar 7 3) 7) 2 0))
    (add c0 c1))            ; verdict 3 when both claims land
```

Keep the band **self-contained** — prelude only your own recipe (+ `core.fk`). If your recipe
composes others, list each in the prelude header and in the validate command, in dependency order.
(`core.fk` is the right prelude for a *band*, because `validate.sh` loads `source-compiler` to lower it.
A recipe meant for a **raw-eval / Layer-1 context** — a carrier, the flatten, `build-form-cli` — must not
lean on `core.fk`'s helpers there; prelude `core-native.fk` instead. See the `unbound function` note in
Troubleshooting for the full two-layer picture.)

## The primitive set — these and no others

`eq · gt · ge · add · and · not · nth · head · tail · len · list · cons · if · empty · str_eq`
plus `defn · let · do`. (Read `form/form-stdlib/core.fk` — it is the whole vocabulary.)

- `eq` compares **integers and nodes**; `str_eq` compares **strings**. Don't cross them.
- `cons` prepends: `(cons x xs)` → a list with `x` at the head. Build lists with `cons` + recursion
  (see `feature-vector.fk`'s `fv-hist-loop`).
- `empty` **constructs** the empty list (`(empty)`, no args) — it is the absence value, **not a
  predicate**. Test emptiness with `(eq (len x) 0)`. See trap 6.
- This is the **curated band-verdict subset, not the kernel's limit.** `mul`/`sub`/`div` and full IEEE
  floats all work and **compute deterministically across the Go/Rust/TS floor** (proven: integer `mul`, `0.1+0.2`, and a
  float matvec all → 0 divergent). The kernel is a full numeric engine reading
  `docs/coherence-substrate/numeric-formats.canonical.json` (19 formats incl. bf16/fp8/nf4/int8/bitnet-158).
  These are kept out of *bands* only because verdicts stay integer for clean `eq`-parity. For numeric/ML
  recipes use the full engine, and reduce a float result to an integer verdict with `round`/`floor`/`ceil`/`trunc`.

## The traps (each one cost a real debugging cycle)

1. **`and` and `or` are BINARY. Never write `(and a b c)`.** Go and Rust silently **drop the third
   argument** while TS folds it — a real divergence (239 vs 255 in `learned-primitive.fk`). Nest:
   `(and (and a b) c)`. `validate.sh` catches it as a divergence, but nesting up front saves the round-trip.

2. **No `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `lt`, `le`.** Express everything with `add` + comparisons + recursion:
   - `a < b` → `(gt b a)` · `a <= b` → `(ge b a)`
   - "decrease / difference" → **count with recursion**, don't subtract.
   - a mean/ratio that needs division → redesign as a **proven-count gate** (`(ge correct min)`),
     the way `classifier-eval.fk` and `self-grounding-classifier.fk` do. Most perception logic is
     counting, selection, and gating — which the primitive set covers exactly.

3. **Float COMPUTE is deterministic; raw-float EQ is the trap.** A fractional float result agrees
   bit-for-bit across the Go/Rust/TS floor (proven); what's unreliable is `eq` on raw floats — and whole-number floats
   still display inconsistently (`3.0` vs `3`). So compute in float, then reduce to an INTEGER verdict —
   `(eq (round (mul r 100.0)) 40)` — and `eq` the integer. `round` is half-AWAY-from-zero on every kernel;
   see `tests/float-conversions-band.fk`. Band SCORES still default to integers `0..100`; floats are the
   numeric/ML payload, not the verdict.

4. **No `let` inside a `defn` body.** Use nested `defn`s or extra parameters. (`let` is fine only at
   the top level of the band's `(do ...)`.)

5. **Loop via recursion** — there is no loop form. The max-select shape (pick the best candidate over
   a list) is in `sequence-predictor.fk` / `recognition-router.fk`'s `rr-select-loop`; copy it.

6. **`(empty x)` is NOT "is x empty?".** `empty` constructs the absence value; `(empty anything)`
   returns `[]`, which `if` treats as **truthy** — so `(if (empty xs) A B)` **always** takes branch A.
   The failure is silent: 0 divergent, just a wrong verdict (a recursion that never recurses, a guard
   that never guards). Test emptiness with `(eq (len x) 0)` — the idiom every recipe uses
   (`nearest-shape.fk`, `sequence-predictor.fk`). Cost a cycle in `learning-arc.fk` (verdict 88, not 127).

## Prove it on all covered kernels

From the repo's `form/` directory, list **every** file explicitly — `core.fk`, your recipe, any
recipes it composes, then the band:

```
cd form
./validate.sh form-stdlib/core.fk form-stdlib/<name>.fk form-stdlib/tests/<name>-band.fk
```

Success is `✓ ... → <verdict>` **and** `1 ok, 0 divergent`. Iterate until you see your intended
verdict with zero divergence. `validate.sh` always runs Go, Rust, and TypeScript. When the band's
stem is listed in `form/fourth-arm-bands.txt`, it also runs on the emitted universal walker `fkwu`
and prints `fourth arm: ... four-way (fkwu + pre-flattened tables)`.

The authoring floor is four-kernel when the band can live in the fourth-friendly subset: add the band
to `form/fourth-arm-bands.txt` and iterate until `validate.sh` proves the fourth arm. When the band
uses an unsupported fourth-arm family, keep the 3-kernel result explicit in evidence as `3-kernel only`
and name the blocker, such as host I/O, node/substrate operations, or multiline output. (Passing a
named top-level recipe as a value and calling it — the semiring-generic dispatch in
`geometric-learning.fk`, `gl-gstep edges x zero cfn wfn ctx` — DOES cross four-way; the fourth arm
carries that higher-order shape. A very large composed table can still overflow the walker, which is a
capacity wall, not an op-family wall — see `transformer-block-assembly`.)

- `unbound function` → a misspelled name, a primitive that isn't in `core.fk` — **or the two-layer
  trap.** `core.fk`'s helpers (`nil? map filter foldl reverse range take drop any? all? …`) live in the
  `section [form.bml]` dialect that only exists *after* `source-compiler.fk` lowers it. A band run with
  `validate.sh form-stdlib/core.fk …` gets them (the validate chain loads source-compiler). But a
  **raw-eval / Layer-1 context** — a carrier, the flatten, `build-form-cli`, any `(do …)` cat'd straight
  onto a kernel — runs before that lowering, so `nil?` is unbound *even though it is in core.fk*. There,
  prelude `form-stdlib/core-native.fk` (the walker-side raw twin) — for the fkwu/fourth arm the raw base
  is `form-stdlib/fourth-shim.fk`. Same helper set, three carriers, one proven shape.
- `N divergent` (kernels print different numbers) → almost always a 3-arg `and`/`or`; nest it.
  A second cause: a **scientific-notation float literal** (`1.16e-05`). The three walkers parse it,
  but the fourth arm's pre-flattened table does not — write floats as plain decimals
  (`0.000011682...`). This bit the q6k-dequant band (fourth = -5 vs three-way 11215).
- wrong verdict, 0 divergent → a band claim is false; fix the recipe or the claim. **Never weaken a
  claim to make it pass** — the band is the truth, not the obstacle.

## Honest bands

Each bit asserts something that could be false and would matter. Prove both the positive (it
recognizes) and the negative (it stays silent / flags novel / refuses below the floor). A band that
only checks `1 == 1` is theatre. Pick the simplest, strangest edge that pins the boundary — a tie, a
just-below-threshold value, an empty input — one expression each.

## When it proves

Write the teaching `docs/coherence-substrate/<name>.form` (Lisp-comment voice, like
`recognition-router.form`), add its INDEX row, and ship in one commit — edges land with the content.
If you're a subagent in a workflow, return the contents instead and let the parent integrate.

*Examples worth reading whole: `recognition-router.fk` (routing + consensus), `nearest-shape.fk`
(a classifier from primitives), `perception-pipeline.fk` (composition), `substrate-phase.fk` (state
without mutation). The whole `form/form-stdlib/tests/` directory is worked bands.*
