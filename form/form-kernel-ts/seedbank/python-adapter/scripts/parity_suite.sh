# parity_suite.sh — verify that every Python demo runs identically
# through CPython, the Form-native compiled .fk path, and the Form-native
# kernel-bmf walker.
#
# The bi-directional execution claim Urs named — "ALL of the current
# python code that is talking to the substrate bi-directionally shall
# be converted into native form code and that shall be the primary
# execution pipeline" — requires three-way parity for every shipped
# Python file. This suite is the regression gate.
#
# === The released bootstrap seam ===
#
# The bootstrap existed to prove the Form-native pipeline matches CPython
# before we could rely on it. That proof is in, and the TS Python parser /
# evalPython path was deleted in the 2026-06-07 compost. This gate now keeps
# three value witnesses without reopening that deleted seam:
#
#   1. CPython evaluates the source file's final expression.
#   2. kernel-bmf-compile emits .fk through Form-native grammar rules, then
#      form-kernel-rust executes the compiled recipe.
#   3. kernel-bmf-run reads the .py through the Form-native walker end to end.
#
# Add new files to PARITY_FILES below as they're ripened.
# Optional args narrow the run to specific files, which keeps repair loops
# tight after a focused example change without weakening the full release gate.
# Run from form/form-kernel-ts/.
