# python_typing_compose_demo.py — three surfaces composing.
#
# Closes the loop on PR #2057 (typeann), #2058 (imports + math), and
# #2060 (classes) by exercising all three in a single file that runs
# identically under CPython, kernel-bmf-run, and form-kernel-rust.
#
# The composition matters because each surface was shipped on its own
# branch from the `floats` foundation; without a demo that joins them
# the three-way parity claim is only proven per-surface, not per-program.
# This file is the proof that the substrate-grammar surfaces compose.
#
# What's exercised here:
#   - `from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Tuple, Any, Callable` —
#     parser binds each typing name to the opaque-sentinel native; the
#     names are only referenced inside annotation slots, which are
#     parse-and-ignored, so the native never fires at runtime. All six
#     names import cleanly; only the single-argument forms (`List[T]`,
#     `Optional[T]`) are exercised in annotation bodies — multi-argument
#     subscripts (`Dict[k, v]`, `Tuple[a, b]`) are an honest gap of the
#     v1 subscript parser, named below.
#   - `class Bucket:` with typed `__init__(self, label: str, base: int, …)`
#     — class lowering + parameter annotations using built-in + typing
#     names side by side.
#   - typed instance methods `score(self) -> int` and
#     `shifted(self, delta: int) -> Optional[int]` — return annotations
#     that reference typing-imported names alongside built-ins.
#   - `class Tally:` with a typed method whose parameter is
#     `List[Bucket]` — composing user-class identity inside a typing
#     generic, exercising the recursive subscript-in-annotation path.
#   - typed variable annotations on locals and module-level bindings —
#     both bare (`header: str`) and annotated-assignment forms.
#
# The runtime path the kernel walks is identical to the un-annotated,
# un-imported version: annotations dropped, imports rewritten to noops,
# classes lowered to constructor + lifted methods. The compose demo is
# evidence that those three lowerings interleave without surprise.
#
# Gaps named for the next breath:
#   - Multi-argument generic subscripts: `Dict[str, int]`, `Tuple[int, str]`,
#     `Callable[[int], int]`. The v1 subscript parser accepts a single
#     index expression — extending to comma-separated index lists is one
#     follow-up. The import of `Dict`, `Tuple`, `Callable` still binds
#     cleanly; only their use inside subscripts is the open gap.
#
# Runs identically under:
#   python3 python_typing_compose_demo.py             — CPython
#   kernel-bmf-run <file.py>                 — kernel-bmf-run
#   form-kernel-rust python_typing_compose_demo.fk    — native kernel binary
