# endpoint_nodeid_distance_demo.py — the body of /api/utils/nodeid_distance,
# captured as pure Python and compiled to a Form recipe.
#
# Second endpoint transmuted under the @serve_via_kernel habit. The
# substrate locates every cell at a NodeID(package, level, type, instance).
# Manhattan distance over those four coordinates is the cheapest
# structural-proximity signal — useful for "what's near this cell?"
# without crossing a graph traversal. Pure integer arithmetic; the
# substrate stays a numeric lattice, not a query language.
#
# Three runtimes produce identical results:
#   - CPython
#   - kernel-bmf-run
#   - form-kernel-rust
