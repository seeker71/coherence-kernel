# endpoint_coherence_weight_demo.py — the body of a FastAPI endpoint,
# captured as pure Python and compiled to a Form recipe.
#
# This file is the proof-of-shape for the question Urs named:
# "can we replace FastAPI with native Form kernel" — the first transmutation
# gesture. The endpoint /api/utils/coherence_weight in api/app/routers/utils.py
# now runs this exact computation through form-kernel-rust instead of
# executing Python inline. FastAPI stays as the HTTP doorway; the body
# is a Form recipe.
#
# What the endpoint does: given a list of integer values and a threshold,
# compute a weighted coherence score where each above-threshold value
# contributes with a position-based decay (first counts 100×, second 50×,
# third 25×, rest 10×) plus a bonus of 100× the count of above-threshold
# entries. Same shape as python_substrate_demo.py — distinct values so
# it's its own parity-suite entry.
#
# Three runtimes produce identical results:
#   - CPython (the FastAPI shim still calls this on the parity_suite path)
#   - kernel-bmf-run
#   - form-kernel-rust (what the live endpoint actually shells into)
