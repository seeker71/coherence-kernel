# endpoint_weighted_average_demo.py — the body of /api/utils/weighted_average,
# captured as pure Python and compiled to a Form recipe.
#
# Third endpoint transmuted under the @serve_via_kernel habit. The
# weighted average of a list of coherence-style scores against a list
# of weights is the substrate's bread-and-butter combinator — every
# multi-signal coherence aggregation goes through this shape.
#
# Floats throughout: scores live in [0.0, 1.0]; weights live in [0.0, 1.0]
# and need not sum to 1.0 (the result divides by total weight). Pure
# IEEE 754; the chosen inputs are exact binary fractions so the three
# runtimes' rendered tail values match byte-for-byte.
#
# Three runtimes produce identical results:
#   - CPython
#   - kernel-bmf-run
#   - form-kernel-rust
