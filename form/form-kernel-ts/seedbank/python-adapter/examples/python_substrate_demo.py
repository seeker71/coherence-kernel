# python_substrate_demo.py — Python with the same shape as real
# substrate-talking code: helper functions, accumulator loops over
# lists, conditional dispatch by position. Not a toy — exercises
# every Python construct the pipeline supports end-to-end.
#
# Computes a weighted-coherence score over a (cell-id, score) list:
#   - filter pairs below threshold
#   - weight remaining by index-position decay (later items count less)
#   - sum into integer coherence (weights expressed as percent-of-100
#     to stay in integer arithmetic — the kernel's MATH arms are
#     int-only today; float natives are an honest follow-up gap)
#
# Runs identically across CPython, kernel-bmf-run, and form-kernel-rust.
