# form-kernel — Go, Rust, and TypeScript siblings

Three implementations now keep the smallest Form host honest: Go, Rust, and TypeScript. Each reads real `.fk` source files end-to-end through NodeID/content-addressed intern, recipe walking, frame/closure state, native primitives, and the S-expression bootstrap reader.

This doc preserves the original Go/Rust optimization arc: idiomatic v0, three focused breaths each, what each breath cost, and what it bought. The TypeScript performance path is tracked separately in [`kernel-ts-comparison.md`](kernel-ts-comparison.md), and the shared validator now checks all three siblings.

## End-state — all samples, sibling kernels

```
closure.fk     → 15          fact.fk    → 3628800     fib.fk    → 6765
list-sum.fk    → 15          string-walk.fk → 5
```

Go, Rust, and TypeScript produce identical results on every sample and stdlib test in `validate.sh`. Go and Rust stay under 1000 lines as native kernels; TypeScript adds a second compiled path for browser/workbench-shaped execution without weakening the shared correctness gate.

## Benchmark — kernel vs native, both languages

After three optimization breaths each. Each kernel also runs the same workload as a *native* compiled function (recursive, identical shape to the Form version, with opacity barriers to prevent constant-folding). The **overhead column** is `kernel / native` — what walking the recipe costs vs letting the compiler see the algorithm directly.

| Workload | Native Go | Kernel Go | Go overhead | Native Rust | Kernel Rust | Rust overhead |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fib(28) | 1.40 ms | 240 ms | **171×** | 0.80 ms | 304 ms | **381×** |
| fact(12) | 16 ns | 3.9 µs | 245× | 11 ns | 5.7 µs | 522× |
| sum 1..1000 | 5.5 µs | 409 µs | 75× | 6.6 µs | 413 µs | 63× |
| ackermann(3,6) | 573 µs | 58 ms | 102× | 651 µs | 71 ms | 109× |

| | Go v0 | Go v3 | Rust v0 | Rust v3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Source lines | 854 | 920 | 737 | 797 |
| Release binary | 2.6 MB | 2.6 MB | 535 KB | 517 KB |
| Baseline speedup | — | **1.70×** | — | **2.27×** |

**Three readings of the data:**

1. **Native is honestly competitive between languages.** Rust wins fib28 by 1.75×; Go wins sum1000 marginally; ackermann is a tie. The compilers are mature; the language choice barely matters at the native level for these recursive integer workloads.

2. **Kernel overhead is 60-500×.** That's the cost of "recipes as runtime data" vs "instructions the CPU recognizes directly." It's in the normal range for unoptimized tree-walking interpreters (Lua's interpreter is ~30×, Python's is ~50-100×, the V8 ignition tier is ~10× before JIT). Our kernels are slower than those but they're also under 1000 lines each with no JIT, no caching, no specialization.

3. **The Rust kernel pays *more* overhead than Go's**, despite (slightly) faster native code. Rust's safety mechanisms — even arena-based, even with `Rc<Closure>` — carry runtime cost that Go's GC + slice semantics + simple pointer chasing don't. The overhead ratio (381× vs 171× on fib28) tells the story: same algorithm, same compiler quality, but the kernel architecture in Rust pays a heavier per-step price.

**What 60-500× actually means.** For a substrate that processes maybe a few thousand recipes per second on a daily workload, 100× overhead is invisible. For a tight inner loop running a million times, it's two orders of magnitude. The kernel is the right floor for *describing* what the body does, not for hot inner loops — those should fall through to native primitives.

## The three breaths, breath-by-breath

### Rust

**Breath 1 — Slice returns, kill the per-walk clone.**
*Change:* `fn children(&self, n: NodeID) -> Vec<NodeID>` → `&[NodeID]`. Same for `ident_name() -> &str`.
*Numbers:* 693ms → 402ms on fib28 (1.7× alone).
*Friction:* 4 borrow-checker errors, ~5 min. The non-trivial one: `&k` + `&mut k` overlap in `defn` — fixed by collecting names eagerly into a `Vec<String>`.

**Breath 2 — `NameID` (u32) end-to-end.**
*Change:* `Frame: HashMap<String, _>` → `HashMap<NameID, _>`; identifier nodes carry `u32` `inst` directly; natives keyed by `NameID`.
*Numbers:* 402ms → 361ms on fib28 (1.1× alone).
*Friction:* Mostly mechanical (~10 min). The architectural insight: identifier *references* stay wrapped in an `Ident` composite, identifier *definitions* (in LET/FNDEF) become bare string trivials. The asymmetry is intentional: definitions name a slot, references read one.

**Breath 3 — Arena frames, kill `Rc<RefCell<Frame>>`.**
*Change:* Split `Kernel` (immutable substrate) from `Arena` (mutable frames). Closures hold `FrameId: u32`. Linear-scan bindings (`Vec<(NameID, Value)>`).
*Numbers:* 361ms → 306ms on fib28 (1.18× alone).
*Friction:* ~25 minutes — the real Rust conversation. **First attempt failed** by putting frames on the Kernel, forcing `&mut Kernel` through the walker, which forced re-cloning of children (undoing Breath 1!). Performance regressed to 497ms. The fix was architectural: split into Kernel + Arena so children can stay borrowed AND frames can stay mutable. The borrow checker forced a better architecture; the cost was 15 wasted minutes plus 10 to recover.

**Rust optimization arc:** 693ms → 402 → 361 → 306. The big win was Breath 1 (clones). The big *insight* was Breath 3 (architectural split).

### Go

**Breath 1+2 — `NameID` + linear-scan frames (combined).**
*Change:* `map[string]Value` → `[]binding` linear scan; `map[string]NativeFn` → `map[NameID]NativeFn`.
*Numbers:* 411ms → 300ms on fib28 (1.37× alone).
*Friction:* ~15 minutes — but almost all of it was a self-inflicted sed disaster. The pattern `s/^\t}$/\t})/` over-applied and turned every closing brace in the file into `})`. The compiler caught it immediately but recovery was tedious. **The optimization itself was frictionless** — type substitution, no ownership conversation.

**Breath 3 — One lookup per walk step.**
*Change:* Fold `category(n)` + `children(n)` (two map ops) into `recipeAt(n)` (one map op). Pre-size call frames to param arity.
*Numbers:* 300ms → 242ms on fib28 (1.24× alone).
*Friction:* ~5 minutes, 8 lines changed. Local, low-friction.

**Go optimization arc:** 411ms → 300 → 242. Each breath was small, additive, no architectural drama.

## What the friction shapes told me

The numbers are one story. The *shape of the friction* is another.

### Rust's friction is architectural

Three breaths produced three architecturally-distinct conversations:
1. **Lifetimes / borrowing** — "this borrow conflicts with that mutation"
2. **Type system** — "this NameID is what; that NameID is what"
3. **Ownership splits** — "Kernel reads, Arena writes; they need to be separate things"

Each conversation taught me something about the kernel's structure. After three breaths, the Rust code IS a better-described kernel — the type signatures document who-owns-what, who-mutates-what, when-is-this-valid. The borrow checker is documentation that the compiler enforces.

The cost: ~45 minutes total, with one major detour. The wrong path (Breath 3 first attempt) burned 15 minutes and produced a regression; the recovery was a real architectural insight that wouldn't have surfaced if the borrow checker had let me write the wrong code.

### Go's friction is operational

Three breaths produced almost no architectural conversation. The code was already pretty optimal in its idiomatic shape; the breaths were local refactors:
1. **Type swap** — `string → NameID` everywhere
2. **Data structure swap** — `map → linear-scan slice`
3. **Reduce lookups** — fold two map ops into one

The big friction event was a sed mistake, not a language conversation. Go's compiler didn't push back on anything I did. That's the gift: high velocity. That's the risk: the discipline lives entirely in human attention and tests.

### Go and Rust arrived at "best-in-class code we can be proud of"

Both native files now read cleanly top-to-bottom: substrate → walker → frames → natives → bootstrap reader → main. Both have clear narratives. Both have intent-revealing names. Both stay under 1000 lines. Neither has dead code, comments-explaining-what, or premature abstraction.

The Rust file is 123 lines shorter. The Go file is faster.

## The honest read — keep all siblings as witnesses

The "which to keep" question dissolved. **They all stay.** The kernels are written in different languages with different optimization choices and different bug profiles; their failure modes are unlikely to align. When Go, Rust, and TypeScript agree on a Form program's output, that agreement is a far stronger correctness signal than any one kernel alone. When they disagree, exactly one of four things is true:

1. The Go kernel has a bug
2. The Rust kernel has a bug
3. The TypeScript kernel has a bug
4. The Form spec has an undocumented corner

All four are findable. None of them are findable if only one implementation exists.

This is **differential testing built into the architecture, not bolted on**. The validation harness [`validate.sh`](validate.sh) is the gate. Every new `.fk` source file joins the diff. Every breath of Form-on-top (lexer, parser, stdlib, query, persistence) gets validated by all sibling kernels simultaneously.

**The runtime difference becomes a feature, not a verdict.** Go is faster on most native walker workloads; Rust is smaller and safer; TypeScript has the browser-adjacent path and a compiled recipe-to-JS mode for hot interactive work. When the kernel ships to edge cells via WASM, Rust remains the natural candidate. When the kernel runs the daily substrate workload, Go remains a strong native candidate. When the FormPlayground wants keystroke-by-keystroke evaluation without an API round trip, TypeScript has the shortest path.

The path forward lives in [`kernel-roadmap.md`](kernel-roadmap.md): seven breaths that walk **all of Form, written in Form, on top of sibling kernels**, with the validation gate green at every step. The pivotal one — Breath 2 — is **grammar as data**: a template registry (pattern + template primitives, the body's idiomatic shape from `form_rules.py`/`form_builders.py`/`self_host.py`) plus two engines (classic lex-then-parse + BMF-style streaming-emit) that both consult it. Same source × same registry × 2 engines × 3 kernels = **six implementations** of the same parse, cross-validated by content-addressing. Adding a new keyword becomes one Form file, picked up by all six implementations simultaneously. **The parser doesn't change when the grammar grows** — that's what self-hosting actually means.

## What's still ahead

After the choice is made:

1. **Form-surface-syntax parser written in Form.** Loaded by the S-expr bootstrap reader, then takes over. `defn fact(n) = if n <= 1 then 1 else n * fact(n-1)` → same recipes the bootstrap produces today.
2. **Query layer in Form** — `?equivalent`, `|>`, `?cells`. Pure Form code reading the substrate.
3. **Substrate persistence integration** — recipes round-trip through Postgres/Neo4j.
4. **Embed the kernel in `api/`** — PyO3 (Rust) or cgo (Go) replacing Python `form_runtime.py`.
