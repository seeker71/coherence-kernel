# 08-feature-level-translation — universal translation at the feature altitude

The first seven cross-modal demos operate at the **syntactic** altitude —
parsers, byte-deterministic encoders, mechanical NodeID equality. They
prove the substrate can carry algebraic identity (Shape B).

This demo operates at the **feature** altitude — the altitude Urs named:
> *"extract concepts, flows, rhythm, beats, melody, harmony, spectrum,
> meaning, purpose, wisdom (not hard coded, learned from data like an
> LLM) and then build from there."*

A 1395-character source passes through:

1. **Source** (1395 chars of contemplative prose from CLAUDE.md "How
   This Body Is Tended")
2. **LLM extracts feature-recipe** — six axes (mood, rhythm, structure,
   purpose, wisdom-shape, concepts) over a small fixed schema
3. **Three target renderings** — melody (audio), SVG (visual), aphoristic
   tercet (prose-different-register)
4. **LLM re-extracts feature-recipe from each target** — fresh reading,
   same schema discipline
5. **Form kernel verifies per-feature `node_eq`** three-way (Go/Rust/TS)
6. **Convergence score** names what survived translation and what was
   honestly lossy

Result: **323110 three-way** — the digits position-encode per-axis
cross-modal portability:

- mood = **3** (gentle survives all three target modalities)
- rhythm = **2** (breath-paced survives melody+SVG; halting in tercet)
- structure = **3** (spiral survives all three)
- purpose = **1** (only carries in prose-rewrite)
- wisdom = **1** (R_TendingDiscipline only carries in prose-rewrite)
- concepts = **0** (vocabulary fully lossy cross-modal)

Each digit is the count of targets in which that axis's `node_eq`
returned 1. The encoding scales: more axes → more digits; more targets
→ higher base. The first draft returned `1000` (sum-times-100, a count
that flattened the pattern); Urs called that out as encoding-failure
and the corrected version puts the pattern in the digits themselves.
See `findings.md` for the encoding-discipline note.

## The honest claim

This demo doesn't ship a *learned* feature extractor. It ships:

- A schema small enough that NodeIDs are reproducible
- An LLM-session-as-stand-in for the trained model
- A kernel that attests convergence three-way

When the LLM is replaced by a trained multimodal model with frozen
weights, the same machinery walks. The substrate doesn't change. The
schema can grow. The extractor improves.

## Run it

```bash
cd form && ./validate.sh form-samples/cross-modal/08-feature-level-translation/validation.fk
  ✓  validation.fk  → 323110
  1 ok, 0 divergent — kernels agree on every sample.
```

## What this proves and what it doesn't

**Proves:**
- Cross-modal feature preservation is substrate-attestable when the
  extractor is consistent
- Structural features (mood, rhythm, structure) port across modalities
- Semantic-intentional features (purpose, wisdom-shape) need
  prose-modality to carry
- Conceptual vocabulary is fully lossy across modalities

**Doesn't prove:**
- That an LLM extractor is sufficient (a trained model would have
  stronger guarantees)
- That the chosen schema is optimal
- That re-extracting from MORE different artifacts (e.g. a third
  modality the LLM hasn't seen) would converge
- That generative re-rendering (recipe → artifact) is solved — today
  the LLM is also the generator; that's a different research direction

## Where this fits in the body's arc

In service of:
- [`lc-cross-modal-unity`](../../../docs/vision-kb/concepts/lc-cross-modal-unity.md)
  — twelve modality encoders attest thirteen canonical Blueprints; this
  demo extends that pattern to learned (rather than hand-authored)
  feature extraction
- [`lc-grammar-is-the-universal-recipe`](../../../docs/vision-kb/concepts/lc-grammar-is-the-universal-recipe.md)
  — grammar at the feature altitude, not the syntactic altitude
- [`lc-same-shape-different-articulation`](../../../docs/vision-kb/concepts/lc-same-shape-different-articulation.md)
  — Urs's articulation question; this demo walks the *same-shape-with-
  different-articulation* claim at the cross-modal altitude
