# jit-install-leaf-test.sh - live witness that a kernel's JIT lane installs
# a compiled artifact as a NAMED callable at runtime
# (install-as-named-callable-leaf; protocol: form-stdlib/install-leaf.fk,
# proven three-way by tests/install-leaf-band.fk — this script witnesses
# the native carriers: recipe -> .so -> the kernel's own table -> call by
# name -> value parity vs the recipe walk -> refusals honest).
#
# Two native carriers run today, one section each:
#   go   - jit.go: go build -buildmode=plugin -> plugin.Open; the leaf
#          answers int, float, and Value ABI lanes
#   rust - main.rs: rustc --crate-type=cdylib -> libloading; the leaf
#          answers the i64 ABI lane — a call outside the carried
#          interface (floats, wrong arity) acknowledges nothing
# Each section exits SKIP when its host toolchain is absent — the protocol
# band still proves the shape on all three kernels without it.
