"""Proof harness for the kernel-router's BIDIRECTIONAL HEADER PASSTHROUGH.

Where router_real_app_harness.py proved the reversed topology fans out method +
body to the REAL FastAPI app and relays status + body, this proves the matured
fan-out arm carries HEADERS both ways with reverse-proxy hop-by-hop hygiene:

  UP   — the client's end-to-end REQUEST headers (Authorization, Cookie, Accept*,
         User-Agent, X-*, Content-Type) reach the upstream, so the fan-out can
         front an authenticated / content-typed route truthfully. Host is
         rewritten to the upstream; the client's Content-Length is dropped (the
         router re-derives it from the body it captured); hop-by-hop headers
         (Connection, Keep-Alive, Transfer-Encoding, Upgrade, Proxy-*, TE,
         Trailer) are stripped — the router owns its upstream-hop framing.
  DOWN — the upstream's RESPONSE headers (Content-Type, Set-Cookie,
         Cache-Control, Location, ETag, X-*) reach the client, so a JSON/HTML
         route survives the proxy instead of being flattened to text/plain and a
         cookie/redirect/cache directive is not lost. The router still owns its
         own client-hop framing (Content-Length, Connection); the upstream's
         hop-by-hop + framing headers are NOT relayed.

TWO upstreams, each proving what it is best placed to prove (honest split):

  • the REAL FastAPI app (app.main:app, dev sqlite, throwaway port) — proves the
    DOWN direction against a genuine route: GET /api/health relayed with
    Content-Type: application/json (the real upstream's), NOT text/plain. Also
    the no-regression checks: a native route still serves in Form, a fan-out GET
    still returns the real app's JSON body.

  • a mock ECHO upstream (http.server) — proves what no fixed real route cleanly
    exposes: (1) the UP direction — it echoes every request header it RECEIVED
    back in the response body, so the harness can assert the client's
    Authorization / Cookie / X-Probe arrived and the hop-by-hop Connection /
    client Content-Length / original Host did NOT; (2) Set-Cookie + Cache-Control
    relay DOWN; (3) the upstream's own hop-by-hop response headers (a bogus
    Transfer-Encoding / Connection it emits) are NOT relayed — the router owns
    that framing.

This is a LOCAL side-by-side proof. It touches NO production routing — the real
app runs on a throwaway test port against the dev sqlite DB; the production front
door is untouched.
